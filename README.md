# Minimalist-Gallery-Site

## Tech stack

- HTML5
- CSS
- SCSS

## Project Abstract

The brainchild of project-based-learning; I tried my hand at learning HTML and CSS- two prominent front end languages- over the span of 3 days; after which I felt comfortable swimming by myself in deeper waters. I massed my interest in contemporary art, world travel, and this trending concept of minimalism, to create a minimalist gallery which features a html-css skeleton.

## Run
- I've webhosted via Github pages; site [link](https://devarshi-ap.github.io)
